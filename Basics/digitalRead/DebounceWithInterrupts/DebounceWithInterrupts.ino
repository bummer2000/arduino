/**
 * This function is an interrupt service routine (ISR) called automatically by the microcontroller
 * based on the attachInterrupt method above. It must take no parameters and return nothing.
 * 
 * Generally, an ISR should be as short and fast as possible. If your sketch uses multiple ISRs, only 
 * one can run at a time, other interrupts will be executed after the current one finishes in an order 
 * that depends on the priority they have.
 * 
 * Inside this function, delay() wonâ€™t work and the value returned by millis() will not increment. 
 * Serial data received while in the function may be lost. You should declare as volatile any variables that 
 * you modify within the attached function. See the section on ISRs below for more information.
